# Information
This page is an official code for [2024 CIKM] Self-Supervised Learning for RF-based Multi-Person Pose Estimation.  
Currently, only the code is accessible; the data, model, installation, training, and inference code will be updated later.

# Update Schedule
- **2025-07-06**: Dataloader refactoring  
- **2025-07-13**: 1. Main & engine refactoring. 2. dataset upload  
- **2025-07-20**: 1. Scratch Reproducibility check. 2. Make tutorial "RGB image visulaization" and "signal visualization"
- **2025-07-27**: pretraining Reproducibility check  

# Update Note
- **2025-07-06**: Dataloader refactoring finished
- **2025-07-13**: Main & engine delete unuse code. 
                : dataset is 128GB. It's taking longer than expected. Sorry for delayed.

# Get Started
## Installation

## Get Data
The data consists of two formats in one frame:  
1. RF signal  
2. RGB image  

The RF signal is stored as a numpy file, and due to its large size, only a portion of the data presented in the paper will be made available.

## Get Model Weight
You can get the model weight file here.

## Train

## Inference
