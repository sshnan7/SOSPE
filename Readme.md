# Information
This page is an official code for [2024 CIKM] Self-Supervised Learning for RF-based Multi-Person Pose Estimation.
Currently, only the code is accessible; the data, model, installation, training, and inference code will be updated later.


# Get sarted
## Installation

## Get data
The data consists of two formats in one frame: 1. RF signal, and 2. RGB image. 
The RF signal is stored as a numpy file, and due to its large size, only a portion of the data presented in the paper will be made available.

## Get model weight
You can get model weight file here.

## Train
